# YouTube_Summarizer_using_BART

The project aims to generate a summary for a YouTube video by leveraging the uploaded or auto-generated subtitles. The summarization process involves two steps: an extractive summarization using the TextRank algorithm from the `sumy` package, followed by a further summarization using the BART model with a maximum limit of 512 words.

In the first step, the subtitles of the YouTube video are extracted and processed using the TextRank algorithm. This algorithm identifies important sentences based on their connectivity and importance within the text. It assigns scores to each sentence and selects the most significant ones to form an intermediate summary.

In the second step, the intermediate summary generated by TextRank is passed through the BART model. BART (Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformer) is a powerful language model capable of generating abstractive summaries. The BART model fine-tuned for summarization tasks is utilized to summarize the intermediate summary into a final summary, ensuring that the final summary does not exceed the limit of 512 words. Since the intermediate summary is fed into the BART summarizer, it is made sure that only the top priority sentences get into the summary pool, thus reducing the workload on the abstractive summarizer

By combining the extractive summarization using TextRank and the abstractive summarization using BART, the project aims to provide a concise and informative summary for YouTube videos, enabling users to quickly grasp the key points and main ideas without having to watch the entire video.
